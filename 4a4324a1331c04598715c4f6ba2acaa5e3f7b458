      "message": "\u003e Each device can have its own set of overlays.\n\nTrue, but this can be problematic if the app is inside APEX and/or the app is installed to /system (both for this case), as I said on the commit message.\n\n* Device-specific resources like `product\u003d\"tablet\"` overrides default resources. Compiled APK will only contain device-specific resources as a result.\n* AFAIK Mainline modules are built in a single target. APEXes built on the target won\u0027t have device-specific resources, just using default (phone). Installing such APEXes on devices other than phone will break.\n* Also it causes system.img divergence among targets, which is against our ongoing effort to make system.img generic.\n\nWe already merged a similar change on Nfc (ag/26255218) and SettingsLib (ag/26012397).\n\n\u003e Have category-wide overloads (the same way we have language-wide overloads)\n\nThis approach was considered but abandoned (ag/24379246).\n\n\u003e Or allow string replacement which are automatically replaced by a platform name\n\nWe can do this by autogenerating RRO, if the app is guaranteed to be installed (e.g. aosp/2950225, aosp/2819317). It won\u0027t work for apps on APEX.",
