      "message": "Making the change here would disable all forms of permanent disables and could lead to unwanted side effects. One example is that the API call to permanently disable a network will stop working and turn into a temporary disable instead.\n\nInstead, it would be safer to check config_wifiDisablePermanentToTemporaryEnable in ClientModeImpl, when the code is triggering permanently blocking due to no internet. From our previous discussion, I think just turning no-internet related blocklisting to temporary blocklist is enough.",
