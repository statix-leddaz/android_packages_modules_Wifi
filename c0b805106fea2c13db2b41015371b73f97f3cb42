      "message": "Making the change here would disable all forms of permanent disables and could lead to unwanted side effects. One example is that the API call to permanently disable a network will stop working and turn into a temporary disable instead.\n\nInstead, it would be safer to check config_wifiDisablePermanentToTemporaryEnable in ClientModeImpl, when the code is triggering permanently blocking due to no internet. From our previous discussion, I think just turning no-internet related blocklisting to temporary blocklist is enough.",

      "message": "I agree to check config_wifiDisablePermanentToTemporaryEnable in ClientModeImpl to avoid unwanted side effects. If we address disable reasons individually, we need to know the frequency of Android Wi-Fi updates to the disable reason list. This will help us estimate the risk of future changes introducing unwanted permanent blocking on ATV devices.\n\nBesides, I want to know more details about the following disable reasons. Do you suggest that we should only turn DISABLED_NO_INTERNET_PERMANENT into temporary blocking, or do you have other permanent blocking disable reason that can also be turned into temporary blocking?\n\n1. DISABLED_BY_WRONG_PASSWORD:\n- If android device has changed the password, it has only connected before password change and never connected again after that. In this case, would Android device put this Wi-Fi into permanent blocklist by this reason? \n\n2. DISABLED_AUTHENTICATION_NO_CREDENTIALS\n- From the user\u0027s perspective, what actions could lead to this state?",
