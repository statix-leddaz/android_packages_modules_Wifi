Because interfaceaddress is initialized during the AP_STA_CONNECTED event and gets cleared from this method as sendP2pConnectionChangedBroadcast is called for every AP_STA_CONNECTED event. But it is not an ideal solution. The reasons are,\n\n1. This is an SDK interface and should be public/system API. This is a custom change which works for your application/use case. We cannot accept this change in AOSP.\n2. This is not the right interface to add interface address. This is a Peer client interface address on the GO side. Where as WIFI_P2P_CONNECTION_CHANGED_ACTION is used for multiple purposes and this field doesn\u0027t make sense for other.",
